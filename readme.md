## PSAP Database
PSAP Database is a web application that allows its users to access PSAP registry entries. A primary PSAP is defined as a PSAP to which 9-1-1 calls are routed directly from the 9-1-1 Control Office, such as, a selective router of 9-1-1 tandems. The PSAP Database serves as a tool to aid the Commission in evaluating the state of PSAP readiness and E9-1-1 deployment.
